output	r_out_surf	Surface runoff, i.e. river contribution	m3/s 
output	r_out_inter	Interflow / sub-surface runoff, i.e. river contribution	m3/s 
output	r_out_base	Baseflow / groundwater contribution to runoff, i.e. river contribution	m3/s 
output	r_out_total	Total runoff, i.e. river contribution	m3/s 

# output normalised to a specific subbain's area, not the whole catchment!
# for catchment output you need to sum subbasin outputs and weight them with the subbasins' areal fractions
output	v_plantwat	Plant available water within rooted zone	m
output	v_soilwat	Total amount of water in soil profile	m
# if choice_runconc > 1 (the WASA approach) this only includes gw storage; if choice_gw <= 0 this is "deep gw" which is lost from the model domain 
output	v_runstor	Total amount of water in runoff storages	m
output	etp	Potential evapotranspiration	m/s
output	eta	Actual evapotranspiration (WITHOUT interception evaporation)	m/s
output	eti	Evaporation from interception storage	m/s
output	run_surf_sat	Total surface runoff (river flow + lateral re-distribution): saturation excess	m/s
output	run_surf_inf	Total surface runoff (river flow + lateral re-distribution): infiltration excess	m/s
output	run_sub	Total subsurface runoff (river flow + lateral re-distribution)	m/s
output	run_gw	Groundwater recharge	m/s
