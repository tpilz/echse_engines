output	r_out_surf	Surface runoff, i.e. river contribution	m3/s 
output	r_out_inter	Interflow / sub-surface runoff, i.e. river contribution	m3/s 
output	r_out_base	Baseflow / groundwater contribution to runoff, i.e. river contribution	m3/s 
output	r_out_total	Total runoff, i.e. river contribution	m3/s 

# output normalised to a specific subbain's area, not the whole catchment!
# for catchment output you need to sum subbasin outputs and weight them with the subbasins' areal fractions
