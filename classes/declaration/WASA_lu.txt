# parameter #
paramNum	frac_area	Areal fraction of LU in subbasin	m2/m2
paramNum	ct_index	Concentration time index (empirical Kirpich formula, for example)	s
sharedParamNum	str_surf	Calibration parameter controlling retention of surface runoff (if ch_runconc = 1; multiplied by ct_index)	dimensionless
sharedParamNum	str_inter	Calibration parameter controlling retention of sub-surface runoff (if ch_runconc = 1; multiplied by ct_index)	dimensionless
sharedParamNum	str_base	Calibration parameter controlling retention in the ground-water reservoir (multiplied by ct_index)	dimensionless
sharedParamNum	choice_runconc	Choice: Runoff concentration approach; 1: Linear storage (only if one SVC per TC per LU!), 2: Hierarchical redistribution approach by Guentner (2004)	dimensionless
sharedParamNum	choice_gw	Choice: Groundwater approach; <=0: disabled (recharge is summed and stored for investigation but not furtherly treated), 1: Simple linear storage approach	dimensionless


# states #
# investigation of vol_surf and vol_inter makes only sense if ch_runconc = 1; otherwise flow is retained at TC level!
stateScal	vol_surf	Storage volume of generated surface runoff	m
stateScal	vol_inter	Storage volume of generated interflow/sub-surface runoff	m
stateScal	vol_base	Storage volume of generated baseflow/groundwater	m


# output #
# ATTENTION: Fluxes are averages over one time step intervall; Volumes the current state at the end of a time step
# all values are area-weighted for summation on Subbasin level; for investigation divide value by areal fraction of LU in Subbasin!
output	r_out_surf	Surface runoff, i.e. river contribution	m/s 
output	r_out_inter	Interflow / sub-surface runoff, i.e. river contribution	m/s
